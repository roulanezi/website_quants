<h1>Here you may find some great resources for learning R</h1>
<p><strong><em>Swirl</em></strong></p>
<p>Swirl, and interactive tutorial. It is an installable package that will run through RStudio.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cookbook for R </em></strong></p>
<p>A very useful online tutorial, especially when it comes to graphs</p>
<p><strong><em>Quick-R</em></strong></p>
<p>Another very useful website, here you will find clear and to the point instructions on how to create new variables, recode the values of existing ones, assign missing cases etc.</p>
<p><strong><em>R-Ladies</em></strong></p>
<p>Those are the ones I use, including R-Ladies, a group aiming to promote gender diversity in the R community.</p>
