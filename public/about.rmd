Here you may find some great resources for learning R
======================


***Swirl***

Swirl, and interactive tutorial. It is an installable package that will run through RStudio.

***Cookbook for R ***

A very useful online tutorial, especially when it comes to graphs

***Quick-R***

Another very useful website, here you will find clear and to the point instructions on how to create new variables, recode the values of existing ones, assign missing cases etc.

***R-Ladies***

Those are the ones I use, including R-Ladies, a group aiming to promote gender diversity in the R community.
